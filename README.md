# FitCheck

## Description
Our app is designed to make fashion fun by gamifying everyday style and inspiring creativity. Here‚Äôs how it works: each night, users receive a theme for the next day‚Äôs outfit- think ‚Äúred‚Äù or ‚Äúdenim.‚Äù The next day, they share photos of their outfits, and friends vote on who nailed the theme best. It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúBeReal,‚Äù but for outfits, with a competitive twist.
